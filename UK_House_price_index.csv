Warnings/Notes,"There are a number of registrations excluded from the version of the Price Paid Data (PPD) used in the UK HPI. These are:all commercial transactions
sales that were not for full market value
transfers, conveyances, assignments or leases at a premium with nominal rent which are:
‘Right to buy’ sales at a discount; subject to an existing mortgage; to effect the sale of a share in a property; by way of a gift; under a Compulsory Purchase order;
under a court order; to Trustees appointed under Deed of appointment; Vesting Deeds Transmissions or Assents; of more than one property; leases for seven years or less.",,,,,,,,
,"For the UK HPI, the standard average house price is calculated by taking the average (geometric mean) price in January 2015 and then recalculating it in accordance with the index change back in time and forward to the present day.",,,,,,,,
,"A 3 month moving average has been applied to estimates below the regional level. For example, at the local authority level, the published estimate for March is a simple average of the calculated estimates for January, February and March. This helps remove some of the volatility in the series at this level.",,,,,,,,
,"There is a time-lag of between 2 weeks and 2 months between the sale of a property and the subsequent registration of this information on the Register. As a result, UK HPI data for the two most recent months will be subject to revision.",,,,,,,,
,The UK HPI measures nominal house price changes and is not adjusted for inflation. ,,,,,,,,
